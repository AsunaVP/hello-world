  <ul>: This is new! It stands for “unordered list,” which is essentially a bulleted list. It’s a double-barreled tag, which means you also need this tag:

  <li>: "List item." It's used for one of the individual bullets inside the <ul>.

Here's how a complete list (like for a list of ingredients, cough ahem) works:

    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    It's a tricky set of tags, but give it a try!

<p style= font-family:Helvetica;font-size:14px; >The Pisco Sour cocktail is a variation of the Whiskey Sour, invented in the early 1920s by American expatriate Victor V. "Gringo" Morris at the Morris' Bar in Lima, Peru. The cocktail quickly became a favorite of locals. Pisco is a South American liquor distilled from grapes. The drink is widely consumed in Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.</p>

  <p style= font-family:Helvetica;font-size:14px;><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul style= font-family:Helvetica;font-size:14px;>
  <li>2 oz pisco (Peruvian grape brandy)</li>
<li>1 oz fresh lime juice</>
<li>1 oz simple syrup (1:1)</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
 <li>Angostura or Amargo bitters</p>

 </ul>

<p style= font-family:Helvetica;font-size:14px;>Preparation</p>

<p style= font-family:Helvetica;font-size:14px;>Combine all liquid ingredients, except the bitters, in a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously for at least ten seconds.
  Add the ice and shake for a full minute. It's important to get it frothy! Strain the liquid into a cocktail glass.
  Top the foam, which is caused by the egg white, with a dash of the bitters.</p>
